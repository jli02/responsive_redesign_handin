    <h2 class="section-heading">Background</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      Oftentimes, websites for local businesses are not created by designers.
      Out of curiosity, I decided to check out the website for my family's own
      business, a small Chinese restaurant called Hunan Garden. (It might come
      as a surprise, but I've never actually seen this website before this
      because I've never had a need to &#128579;)
      <br />
      <br />
      I decided to redesign Hunan Garden's website, not just because it could
      use some touch-ups with regards to usability and accessibility, but also because it's exciting to potentially have the chance to
      give back in some way to my parents and this restaurant that raised me.
    </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p class="section-text">
      Here's what the Hunan Garden website looked like a few weeks ago:
  </p>
        <img
          class="image"
          alt="hunan garden website from a few weeks ago"
          src="./assets/original1.png"
        />

      <br />

      <p class="section-text">Here's what it currently looks like
     
      (<a href="http://www.7689555.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">see for yourself here!</a>):</p>

        <img
          class="image"
          alt="current hunan garden website"
          src="./assets/original2.png"
        />
 
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">The main elements are images, buttons for ordering, business hours, telephone numbers, and the address. There also seems to be 
        a place for announcements, such as "Now Hiring" or "Closed for Vacation."  </p>
      <br>
   
      <h2 class="section-heading">Usability and Accessibility Concerns</h2>
    <p class="section-text">Some initial observations:
 
      <ul class="section-text">
         <li>There are two buttons to order, which may be confusing for new users</li>

      <li>The contents of the page seem a bit scattered and could be organized in
      a more logical order</li>

      <li>The text may be too small in some places, which may make some of the
      important information not as noticeable</li>
      <li>The website is not optimized for mobile screens</li>
      </ul> 
 
</p>
    <p class="section-text">
      Using WAVE, I also found that the website was missing alt text and 
      has a link to a PDF document, which often has accessibility issues. Most
      of the accessibility problems might not be immediately visible, but the website
      should still be redesigned for a wide range of users, including those that may 
      use a screen reader or rely on alt text.
    </p>
    <h2 class="section-heading">Sketches</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        With the above concerns in mind, I did nine quick one-minute sketches before settling on a final sketch.
      </p>

      <img
          class="image"
          alt="quick sketches"
          src="./assets/quick-sketches.png"
        />

        <br>
        <img
          class="image"
          alt="final sketch"
          src="./assets/final-sketch.png"
        />

        <p class="section-text">
        Since I thought the original webpage was a little disorganized, I wanted to create a clear visual hierarchy
        to make the information easier to digest. The final sketch intends to draw the user's eye to the menu and down to
        the order button, hours, location, and so on. I also like the look of having a bar at the top for important
        announcements since it jumps out when a user arrives at the page. In addition, I decided to get rid of repeating
        elements to make the page less confusing, such as having only one button for ordering and one phone number.

        <p class="section-text">I created a visual design style guide for the main colors, typography, and reusable components.
          Since the original website seems to have a fire theme going on (lots and lots and lots of red), I wanted to incorporate 
          red and yellow into the color scheme. The style guide was used to inform the design of the high fidelity mockups.

    <h2 class="section-heading">The Redesign</h2>

    <p class="section-text">
      
      <a href="https://jli02.github.io/responsive_redesign/" target="_blank">Click here to see the redesign!</a></p>
      <p class="section-text">
      I redesigned the website using HTML and CSS. Some of the features are not yet implemented, such as the
    scrollable menu, which is just an image at the moment. The order button would also ideally lead to
    a page where the user can see the menu items and place their order. Hopefully these will be implemented
    in the future! : )</p>
    <p class="section-text">One small change I made from the high-fidelity wireframe to the finished redesign is that I changed the brightness
      of the photo behind the words "Hunan Garden." After testing my redesign using WAVE, I found that
      there were contrast errors and decided to alleviate them by adjusting the brightness. 
      <p class="section-text">Here's what you'll see if you go on the site from a desktop:</p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">Takeaways and Other Thoughts</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      1. Through this project, I gained a greater understanding of the design process for a responsive website.
      It can be very time consuming!! Figuring out the low fidelity wireframes and high fidelity mockups 
      definitely led to a smoother time coding. It's also very important to consider what the website looks like 
      on screens of different sizes. I am normally on my laptop, so I usually don't notice when websites don't adjust to
      tablet and mobile screens. Responsivity and accessibility are big things to consider when developing any
      website.
      </p>
    <p class="section-text">
      2. Even after coding the design, I feel a little conflicted about whether
      this is the "best" website design for the restaurant. I wish I was able to
      convey the cozy, welcoming environment of the restaurant through the
      design. How can we design websites with intention in order to convey a specific feeling or to capture
      the essence of what the website is for? Something I am still mulling over.
      </p>
     <p class="section-text">3. The original website has this cute firefly logo that I wish I was able to incorporate, but it was just difficult
      to find a color scheme for it. Some things you have to leave behind. (But when I do a next iteration of implementing 
      the features for this site, I'd like to find a way to bring the firefly back in. Perhaps it will call for a redesign
      of the logo itself, but that is a project for another time...)</p>
